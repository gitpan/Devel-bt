  * Properly detach gdb from the process it's tracing.
    Do a fork+exit+setsid to stop the spawned gdb process from being a child
    process of the process it's supposed to attach to. Some operating systems,
    notably OpenBSD, forbid ptrace()ing parent processes. ptrace() is what gdb
    needs to attach to a running process.
