  * Avoid infinite recursions caused by errors in the signal handler itself by
    unregistering our handlers as early as possible.

  * abort() after generating the stack trace. exit(0) after a fatal error was
    just wrong.

  * Properly detach gdb from the process it's tracing.
    Do a fork+exit+setsid to stop the spawned gdb process from being a child
    process of the process it's supposed to attach to. Some operating systems,
    notably OpenBSD, forbid ptrace()ing parent processes. ptrace() is what gdb
    needs to attach to a running process.

  * Initial release.
